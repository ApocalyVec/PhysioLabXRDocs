Scripting
###################################

The scripting interface, or RenaScript, is one of the most extensible features PhysioLabXR offers.
It empowers researchers to run user-defined Python scripts, providing full agency for creating and deploying custom data processing pipelines.
With Python's versatility and vast array of fast-growing open-source libraries, users are encouraged to
creatively explore and experiment with novel applications such as close-loop neurofeedback.
Users can implement DSP algorithms, run ML models with real-time data streams,
or communicate with external applications such as a cloud-computing platform through Python APIs.
