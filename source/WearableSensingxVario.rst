Wearable Sensing's DSI-24 and Compatibility with Varjo's XR-3 (Potentially other models as well)
###############################################################################################

This tutorial will demonstrate how to adapt the Varjo XR-3 to the DSI-24.
The `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ is `Wearable Sensing's <https://wearablesensing.com/>`_ dry electrode EEG system.
While the XR-3 is `Varjo's <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ most immersive VR experience with photorealistic visual fidelity.

1. First off you will need to 3D print the following `model<>`_ to attach to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ allow for compatibility.

After you have printed the adapter you will need to remove Varjo's deafult headpiece.

2.  Remove the cushion from the headpiece, you will then see 4 screw holes.

3. Unscrew the 4 screws that connect the "headstrap" to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

4. Carefully unhook the "headstrap" from the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_. There are three hooks on each side of the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

After removing the headstrap from the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ we will need to attach the 3D printed adapter to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

5. Carefully hook the 3D printed adatper to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_. Be careful as the hooks are fragile as they are a small weakly supported piece. It is recommended that you do not screw in the screws before hooking everything in first.

6. Once the adapter is hooked in, screw in the screws to secure the adapter to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

7. Use the front provided straps from `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ to attach the `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ to the adapter. The strap provided by Wearable Sensing for the Meta Quest will also work.

8. You will also need to have additional straps to secure the DSI-24 on the sides.

9. Apply `Velcro's Sleek and Thin <https://a.co/d/3UoSrVQ>`_ to the 3D printed part so that you can attach the cushion back on.

10. Attach the cushion back on to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

11. It is also recommended that you add some foam between the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ and the 3D printed piece to prevent any light from coming into the view area. An alternative would be to drape a piece of clothing over the seams.

Now that you have a working DSI-24 with the XR-3 you can now use PhysioLabXR to integrate the two hardware devices in software.

For example, using
