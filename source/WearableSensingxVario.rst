.. _WearableSensing's DSI-24 X Varjo's XR-3:

############################################################
Wearable Sensing's DSI-24 Compatibility with Varjo's XR-3
############################################################

This tutorial will demonstrate how to adapt the Varjo XR-3 to the DSI-24.
The `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ is `Wearable Sensing's <https://wearablesensing.com/>`_ dry electrode EEG system.
While the XR-3 is `Varjo's <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ most immersive VR experience with photorealistic visual fidelity.

1. First off you will need to 3D print the following `model <https://github.com/LommyTea/WearableSensingXPhysioLabXR/blob/c45434ece156bb65e90b118baffd4701e20ec7d4/Varjo_XR-3_3D%20REV_2.SLDPRT>`_ to attach to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ allow for compatibility.
The model can be found here: `STL File <https://github.com/LommyTea/WearableSensingXPhysioLabXR/blob/c45434ece156bb65e90b118baffd4701e20ec7d4/Varjo_XR-3_3D%20REV_2.SLDPRT>`_

After you have printed the adapter you will need to remove Varjo's deafult headpiece.

2.  Remove the cushion from the headpiece, you will then see 4 screw holes.

3. Unscrew the 4 screws that connect the "headstrap" to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

    </p>

4. Carefully unhook the "headstrap" from the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_. There are three hooks on each side of the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

    </p>

After removing the headstrap from the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_ we will need to attach the 3D printed adapter to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

5. Carefully hook the 3D printed adatper to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_. Be careful as the hooks are fragile as they are a small weakly supported piece. It is recommended that you do not screw in the screws before hooking everything in first.

    </p>


6. Once the adapter is hooked in, screw in the screws to secure the adapter to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

    </p>

7. Apply `Velcro's Sleek and Thin <https://a.co/d/3UoSrVQ>`_ to the 3D printed part so that you can attach the cushion back on.

8. Attach the cushion back on to the `XR-3 <https://varjo.com/products/varjo-xr-3/>`_.

9. Use the front provided straps from `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ to attach the `DSI-24 <https://wearablesensing.com/dsi-24/>`_ to the adapter. The strap provided by Wearable Sensing for the Meta Quest will also work.

10. You will also need to have additional straps to secure the DSI-24 on the sides.

Now that you have a working DSI-24 with the XR-3 you can now use PhysioLabXR to integrate the two hardware devices in software.
